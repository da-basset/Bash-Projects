### Project-User-Backup ###

# This script is NOT complete #

# This script will ask for a user name and then verify that a backup
 is indeed suppose to be created. Then using TAR will archieve and
 then use gzip for compression



# End Game for Script:
#	I want this script to take a provided username and create a tar archieve that is compressed by gzip. 
#	Extra Credit: Have the script push the TAR file to a AWS backup server.
